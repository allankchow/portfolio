# Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository of my dynamic and responsive portfolio website. This project leverages a headless CMS setup with WordPress and a React frontend. Advanced animations are handled via Lottie and GSAP, providing an engaging user experience. The styling is accomplished with SCSS and the application uses Vite for efficient asset management and fast loading times. Code is maintained across multiple devices through GitHub.
